## GrrgOG: The Greg Matthews PhD Soundboard

Have you ever wanted your exam graded when your exam was completed months ago? Have you ever been in need of academic advising from your advisor whilst he yell "get out of my office" as soon as you ask if he's seen your email?
Have you gotten an error message that felt like a millennial yelling, "for F's sake!"

### About GrrgOG

GrrgOG is an R package containing a collection of Dr. Greg Matthews PhDizzle's iconic noises, reactions, and occasional statistics references. This package allows users to play various sound clips with simple function calls.

Key functions in this package include:

- play_OG: Plays a sound from the "OG phrases" collection.

- play_stats: Plays a sound from the "Some statistics" collection.
